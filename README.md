Numpy - NumPy is a Python library that provides a high-performance multidimensional array object, along with tools for working with arrays. It is the fundamental package for scientific computing with Python. NumPy is used by many scientific computing libraries, such as SciPy, Matplotlib, and Pandas.

Pandas - Pandas is a Python library that provides high-performance, easy-to-use data structures and data analysis tools for working with structured (tabular, multidimensional, potentially heterogeneous) and time series data. It is built on top of the NumPy library.

sklearn - Scikit-learn (Sklearn) is the most useful and robust library for machine learning in Python. It provides a selection of efficient tools for machine learning and statistical modeling including classification, regression, clustering and dimensionality reduction via a consistence interface in Python. This library, which is largely written in Python, is built upon NumPy, SciPy and Matplotlib.
